Question:
    how to handle the case where the total number of loop iterations is not a multiple of SIMD vector width.
A:
    Analyzing: check main.cpp::verifyResult finding that unmatching result happening out of the index. So the solution is to make sure the outside-part also caculate correctly instead of intercepting the last segments of data.
    Resolution: creat an array whose size is Vector_WIDTH putting the last segments in data at fisrt, 1 at latter.
