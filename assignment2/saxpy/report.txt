execution Situation:
Overall time: 50.866 ms         [4.394 GB/s]
Over kernel time: 0.000249 ms

recall the serial execution Situation:
performance (64 tasks which suitable with the number of logical processor)
[saxpy serial]:         [18.617] ms     [16.008] GB/s   [1.074] GFLOPS
[saxpy streaming]:      [18.327] ms     [16.261] GB/s   [1.091] GFLOPS
[saxpy ispc]:           [18.501] ms     [16.108] GB/s   [1.081] GFLOPS
[saxpy task ispc]:      [4.822] ms      [61.803] GB/s   [4.148] GFLOPS
            (1.02x speedup from streaming)
            (1.01x speedup from ISPC)
            (3.86x speedup from task ISPC)

Q2: the difference between the timer I added and the timer that was already in the provided starter code.
A: The difference is whther use cudaDeviceSynchronize() which will hold and stall untill all the cuda operations finished or not.

Q3: Are the bandwidth values observed roughly consistent with the reported bandwidths available to the different componets of the machine?
A: this require the knowledge of how multiple-GPU cooperates with each other.
